    id: 'gneuth',
    name: 'Gneuth', 
    type: 'monster', 
    category: 'Monster',
    description: 'Ruler of Stench. Stench of the kind represented by Gneuth is like just a tiny amount of dog poop on your shoe. You\'ll never find it, and nobody will point it out to you.',

    id: 'weweu',
    name: 'Weweu', 
    type: 'monster', 
    category: 'Monster',
    description: 'Ruler of Labor. Labor that doesn\'t matter is like holding a scorpion that just keeps stinging you over and over. Weweu is the "protestant work ethic"â€“ meaningless work that doesn\'t benefit the querent.',

    type: 'monster', 
    category: 'Monster',
    description: 'Ruler of Spite. Spite directed at the querent doesn\'t have to have a reason. Brekoax revels in spite for spite\'s sake, and the querent shouldn\'t look for a \'reason\' for a bad situation.',

    category: 'Monster',
    description: 'Ruler of Waste/Pollution. Any surplus for which the querent doesn\'t have a plan becomes pollution. Djerr celebrates overages: too much, too fast, too intense. The Bird-headed Monster is an avalanche. How do you survive an avalanche?',
